    "Prior to Spark 2.0.0, the three main connection objects were `SparkContext, SqlContext, and HiveContext`. The `SparkContext` object was the connection to a Spark execution environment and created RDDs and others, `SQLContext` worked with `SparkSQL` in the background of `SparkContext`, and `HiveContext` interacted with the Hive stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark 2.0.0 introduced Datasets/DataFrames as the main distributed data abstraction interface and the `SparkSession` object as the entry point to a Spark execution environment. Appropriately, the `SparkSession` object is found in the namespace, `org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession` (Scala), or `pyspark.sql.sparkSession`. A few points to note are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In Scala and Java, Datasets form the main data abstraction as typed data; however, for Python and R (which do not have compile time type checking), the data abstraction is DataFrame. For all practical API purposes, the Datasets in Scala/Java are the same as DataFrames in Python/R.\n",
    "* While Datasets/DataFrames are top-level interfaces, RDDs have not disappeared. In fact, the underlying structures are still RRDs. Also, to interact with RDDs, we still need a SparkContext object and we can get one from the SparkSession object.\n",
    "* The `SparkSession` object encapsulates the `SparkContext` object. As of version 2.0.0, `SparkContext` is still the conduit to a Spark cluster (local or remote)\n",
    "\n",
